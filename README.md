## GoodData JS Bootcamp

The original README.md from create-react-app has been kept
and renamed for your reference. 

This is the end result of the tutorial:  
[How to Create Your First Visualization with GoodData UI SDK](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Create+Your+First+Visualization+with+GoodData+UI+SDK)

The only code changes after create-react-app are:

```
src/App.js - Added Kpi component
catalog.json - new file from catalog download
.gitignore - added .idea/ director
package.json - added gooddata dependency, and changed react and react-dom to version 15
```
